# A Lambda Calculus Interpreter Written in Rust

I'm following the [Lectures Notes on the Lambda Calculus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.3434.pdf) by Peter Selinger. The hope is to follow through the rest of the notes, add more features and extensions as I go through them. Later, I may also implement a front-end that will be compiled to Lambda Calculus for evaluation.
